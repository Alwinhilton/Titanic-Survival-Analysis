# Titanic Survival Analysis
# Overview
This project explores the widely studied Titanic dataset to identify key factors influencing passenger survival and build predictive models. Utilizing Python and various data science libraries, the workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning.

# Dataset
The dataset contains comprehensive information about Titanic passengers, including demographics, ticket details, and survival status. Key features include:

- Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third)

- Name: Passenger name

- Sex: Gender

- Age: Age in years

- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard

- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard

- Ticket: Ticket number

- Fare: Passenger fare

- Cabin: Cabin number

- Embarked: Port of embarkation(C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

test.csv: Dataset used for model testing and performance evaluation.

# Key Findings and Insights
Survival Rate Analysis: EDA revealed survival trends based on gender, passenger class, and age.

Feature Importance: Gender and passenger class emerged as strong predictors of survival.

Model Performance: Several machine learning models were evaluated based on accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of predictive analytics on historical data.

# How to Run
Ensure Python and all required packages are installed.

Open the Titanic-Dataset-Analysis.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.

Uncomment and run the first code cell to install dependencies, if necessary.

# Conclusion
This project showcases how data science techniques can be applied to historical datasets to derive meaningful insights and build predictive models. The Titanic dataset serves as a foundational case study in data analysis, EDA, feature engineering, and machine learning.
